# Palestine-Israel War Peace Plan

## What do we know

The modern Palestine-Israel War started on 7th October 2023 when Hamas launched operation the al-Aqsa Storm a large-scale invasion and offensive against israel from the gaza strip[4], breaking through the Gazaâ€“Israel barrier and forcing entry via the Gaza border crossings, into nearby Israeli settlements and military installations to commit atrocities and war crimes on Re'im music festival goers[5] and israeli citizens including rape, murder and hostage taking claiming it to be a reaction on Israeli blockade and occupation of gaza strip and palestinian territory. [1]

The Israeli blockade of the gaza strip is an ongoing land, air and sea blockade of the Gaza strip imposed by Israel and Egypt since 2005 as a reaction on the Hamas taking control of the gaza strip followed by israeli's disengagement of citizens and military from the area and compensation of more than 200 000 USD in compensation per palestine family.[6]

Such blockade caused people of palestine to live in a form of an open prison from which they cannot escape without risking their life and are starved off of resources, opportunities and are forced to live in poverty and a state of human rights violations for which the Israeli state bares responsibility.[interviews of expats]

## What could we do now?

Hamas is recognized as a terrorist organization known for their brutality that after the operation al-Aqsa Storm surpases that of ISIS and are evidently the sole reason to why are palestinians held in an open prison by their neighbours.

Israeli forces with the support of NATO are therefor to invade the gaza strip and eliminate/capture HAMAS members to be transferred to the international court of justice while taking care to keep the civilian casualities to a best possible minimum.

After Hamas is defeated, the UN shall dispatch a peacekeeping mission to stabilize the country and establish assisted de-occupation of all palestinian territories by israel during which Palestine will sign a demilitarization treaty similar that of Japan after the world war 2.

Palestine is to be given resources needed to:
0. Access drinkable water and nutritious food
1. Repair their country
2. Ensure safety and security of it's citizen
3. Ensure human rights are followed
4. Establish the rule of law

During which the blockade of egypt and israel shall be lifted and their territorial integrity guaranteed by NATO with the projected goal of free and independent palestinian state.
